<p>In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into&nbsp;<a class="extiw" title="w:Bytecode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode">bytecode</a>&nbsp;(as discussed&nbsp;<a title="Java Programming/The Java Platform" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/The_Java_Platform">earlier</a>), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the&nbsp;<code>javac</code>&nbsp;compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extension&nbsp;<code>.class</code>. When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted, using the&nbsp;<a class="extiw" title="w:Just-in-time compiliation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compiliation">just-in-time</a>(JIT) compiler. The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed.</p>
<p>Java code needs to be compiled twice in order to be executed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Java programs need to be compiled to bytecode.</li>
<li>When the bytecode is run, it needs to be converted to machine code.</li>
</ol>
