<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.<br /><br />Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems.</strong></span></p>
