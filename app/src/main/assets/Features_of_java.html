<p>Following are the notable features of Java:</p>
<h4>Object Oriented</h4>
<p>In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</p>
<h4>Platform Independent</h4>
<p>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</p>
<h4>Simple</h4>
<p>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</p>
<p>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</p>
<h4>Architecture-neutral</h4>
<p>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</p>
